The waves crashed against the rocky shore, sending a fine mist into the salty air. Seagulls soared overhead, their calls echoing across the vast ocean. A lone fisherman stood at the edge of the pier, patiently waiting for a catch. The golden sun reflected off the water, creating a dazzling shimmer. In the distance, a lighthouse stood tall, guiding sailors safely to shore.
